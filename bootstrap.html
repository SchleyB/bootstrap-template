                   Chickens don't clap! Don't call my escorts whores. Ann, you need to
                   decide whether you want a man or a boy. I know how I'd answer. I've
                   been in the film business for a while but I just cant seem to get
                   one in the can. This is not me encouraging you to go here and write
                   a review. No. Sister's my new mother, Mother. And is it just me or
                   is she looking hotter? Heart attack never stopped old Big Bear. I
                   didn't even know we were calling him Big Bear. We never had the
                   chance to. Even though so many people in this office are begging for
                   it.

                   If this were a Lifetime Moment of Truth movie, this would be our act
                   break. But it wasn't. This show was cancelled. I mean, COME ON. If I
                   wanted something your thumb touched I'd eat the inside of your ear.
                   You were just a turd out there, you know? You couldn't kick, and you
                   couldn't run, you know? You were just a turd. Oh…yeah…the guy in the
                   $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that
                   in three months.
